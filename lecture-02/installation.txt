For apache2, run the following commands to ensure that mod_rewrite is enabled:

sudo a2enmod status


If it isn’t already enabled, enable a2enmod and restart Apache:
sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo systemctl restart apache2

Log in to the MySQL command line as the root user:
sudo mysql -u root 

Create wordpress database:
CREATE DATABASE wordpress;

Create user and grant them privileges for the newly created user:

CREATE USER 'wpuser' IDENTIFIED BY 'wpuser123';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO 'wpuser';


exit mysql:

Create a directory called src under your website’s directory to store fresh copies of WordPress’s source files. In this guide, the home directory /var/www/html/example.com/ is used as an example. Navigate to that new directory:

sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/example.com/src/
cd /var/www/html/example.com/src/


Set your web server’s user, www-data, as the owner of your site’s home directory:
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/example.com/

Install the latest version of WordPress and extract it:
sudo wget http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
sudo -u www-data tar -xvf latest.tar.gz


Rename latest.tar.gz as wordpress followed by the date to store a backup of the original source files. This will be useful if you install new versions in the future and need to revert back to a previous release:
sudo mv latest.tar.gz wordpress-`date "+%Y-%m-%d"`.tar.gz


Create a public_html directory to be the root directory for WordPress. Move the WordPress files to your public_html folder:
sudo mkdir /var/www/html/example.com/public_html/
sudo mv wordpress/* ../public_html/


Give your web server ownership of the public_html folder:
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/example.com/public_html
